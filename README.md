# Jeopardy
This jeopardy project uses C++ and the SDL2 libaries to access a jeopardy database using sqlite and display in a question-based game that allows the player to answer questions in randomly generated categories to earn points based on difficulty. 


# How to Play

To begin, navigate to */x64/Debug* and run the Jeopardy2023 application file. 
Select between 1 and 2 players. The 1 player mode uses the "S" key to answer questions and the 2 player mode uses the "S" and "K" keys.
Selecting a mode will lead to a screen where the player may select a category and difficulty. The player will have 15 seconds to read the question and come up with an answer. The player must press their respective key, and they will be prompted to "Click to continue". 
Clicking will reveal the correct answer and the player can select whether they answered the question correctly. The scoreboard will be adjusted accordingly and they will be led back to the main screen where they can continue answering more questions. As they answer, the previous questions will disappear from the board until there are none left. At this point, the players can compare scores to deduct a winner.
